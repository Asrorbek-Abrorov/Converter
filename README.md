The program is a converter that operates through a Telegram bot and assists users in converting files. For example, if you have a file in PDF format and you want to convert it to WORD format, you can use our Telegram bot to accomplish this task. You specify the format of the file you have and the format you want to convert it to on the bot, and the bot will send you the ready file for download after specifying the conversion format. However, the bot has its limitations; it cannot convert videos or music files into images, or vice versa. Once you specify a format that can be converted into, the bot will process the file and provide it to you.

Here are some examples of file conversions:

    PDF => WORD
    PDF => HTML
    FILE => BYTE
    FILE => BINARY
    BINARY => TEXT
    TEXT => ASCII
    DECIMAL => BINARY
    DECIMAL => OCTAL
    DECIMAL => HEXADECIMAL
    DECIMAL => PERCENT
    BASE => BASE
    
Functionality: The program stores all user information in a database, including the user's name, surname, username, Telegram account ID, and email. Additionally, information about which user converted which file and for what purpose is also stored in the database. The convenience of this program lies in the fact that you do not need to visit any websites to convert your files; you simply start the bot, upload your files for conversion, and the bot will prepare the converted files for you to download without any advertisements.
